A Stopwatch Web App made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It shows time in minutes, seconds, and centiseconds. The app has buttons to Start, Pause, Reset, and Lap. When you click Lap, it saves the current time and shows it below. This project helped me learn how to use JavaScript to update the page and control time.
